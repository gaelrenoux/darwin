This project is inspired by Play Evolutions.

Differences to Play Evolutions:
- Revision files can be numbered according to actual version numbers, rather than 1.sql, 2.sql, etc.
- Can easily execute SQL scripts
- Can handle variables in scripts (to execute the same SQL script on multiple schemas, for instance)
- Can be used in Play as well as independently
